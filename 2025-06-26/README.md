Handling errors in TypeScript can be messy—try/catch doesn’t scale, Promises fail silently, and unexpected undefined causes headaches. Effect-TS provides a better way by making errors explicit and easy to manage. This talk is a beginner-friendly introduction to Effect-TS. We’ll start with common problems in error handling and show how Effect-TS helps track and handle errors safely. Through real examples, you’ll learn how to manage async operations, avoid hidden failures, and write more reliable TypeScript code. By the end, you’ll know the core concepts of Effect-TS and how to start using it in your projects.
