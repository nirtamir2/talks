# slidev-addon-sandpack

Build stepped, multi-file [CodeSandbox Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) live-code demos in [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) from readable Markdown.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add slidev-addon-sandpack
# npm install slidev-addon-sandpack
# yarn add slidev-addon-sandpack
# bun add slidev-addon-sandpack
```

Activate the addon in the headmatter of your Slidev entry file:

```yaml
---
addons:
  - slidev-addon-sandpack
---
```

## Quick start

Use `@@@` for the demo container and a normal Slidev code-block title for each filename:

````md
@@@

```tsx [App.tsx]
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello from Sandpack</h1>;
}
```

@@@
````

The filename is required. `App.tsx`, `/App.tsx`, and `./App.tsx` all resolve to `/App.tsx`.

## Progressive steps

Add the formatter-safe `<!-- sandpack:step -->` comment between steps. Each step starts with the fully resolved files from the previous step, then replaces or adds the files it declares.

````md
@@@

```tsx [App.tsx]
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Step one</h1>;
}
```

<!-- sandpack:step -->

```tsx [Card.tsx]
export function Card() {
  return <article>Added in step two</article>;
}
```

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { Card } from "./Card";

export default function App() {
  return <Card />;
}
```

@@@
````

The first file declared in a step becomes its active file. File deletion is intentionally not supported in version 1.

## Reusable presets

Create `sandpack.config.ts` beside the deck's entry Markdown file:

```ts
import { defineSandpackConfig } from "slidev-addon-sandpack";

export default defineSandpackConfig({
  defaultPreset: "r3f",
  presets: {
    r3f: {
      template: "react-ts",
      dependencies: {
        three: "^0.176.0",
        "@react-three/fiber": "^9.1.2",
      },
      entry: "/index.tsx",
      files: {
        "/index.tsx": {
          source: "./sandpack/index.tsx",
          hidden: true,
        },
        "/styles.css": {
          source: new URL("./sandpack/styles.css", import.meta.url),
          hidden: true,
          readOnly: true,
        },
      },
      layout: {
        editorSize: 65,
        minHeight: "24rem",
      },
    },
    physics: {
      extends: "r3f",
      dependencies: {
        "@react-three/rapier": "^2.1.0",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Select a named preset after the opening delimiter:

````md
@@@ physics

```tsx [App.tsx]
export default function App() {
  return <PhysicsDemo />;
}
```

@@@
````

See [docs/presets.md](./docs/presets.md) for inheritance, merge rules, source-backed files, layouts, and shareable preset packages.

## Runtime controls

Every demo provides:

- Previous/next step controls with boundary states and a live step announcement.
- Read-only and editable modes.
- Sandpack file tabs, editor diagnostics, and preview refresh controls.
- Keyboard isolation so editor input does not trigger Slidev navigation.
- A contained error state if the embedded renderer fails.

## Compatibility

- Node.js `>=20.19.0`
- Slidev `>=52.1.0`
- React and React DOM `>=18 <20`
- Vue `>=3.4.0`

React and React DOM are peer dependencies. The addon deduplicates them through Vite and does not require `slidev-addon-react`.

## Important behavior

- Slidev treats preparsers as an advanced feature. They can affect editor integrations because the syntax is transformed before normal Markdown rendering.
- After installing or changing preparser setup code, fully stop and start Slidev; a hot restart may not be sufficient.
- Changes to `sandpack.config.ts` or source-backed preset files restart the development server so compiled slide data cannot become stale.
- Sandpack downloads dependencies and runs the preview through CodeSandbox's browser bundler. Do not put secrets, private tokens, or server-only credentials in demo files.
- Source-backed preset files are local build-time files only. Remote `http:` and `https:` source URLs are rejected.

## Troubleshooting

### A fence is rejected

Every fence needs one bracketed filename, such as `tsx [App.tsx]`. Duplicate aliases like `App.tsx` and `/App.tsx` in one step are rejected after normalization.

### A custom entry is missing

When a preset defines `entry`, that file must exist after preset and authored files are resolved for every step.

### The preview cannot install a package

Check the dependency name/version in the selected preset and the browser network console. Sandpack dependency installation requires network access.

## Migrating from the original talk syntax

Replace generated `FilesPlayground` payloads or fences with manual `index`/`file` attributes with an `@@@` container. Put each file path in the fence title and replace index changes with `<!-- sandpack:step -->`. Move shared entry files, styles, and dependency maps into a named preset.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter slidev-addon-sandpack test:run
pnpm --filter slidev-addon-sandpack typecheck
pnpm --filter slidev-addon-sandpack lint
pnpm --filter slidev-addon-sandpack build:example
pnpm --filter slidev-addon-sandpack test:pack
```
